# PropertyMP
PropertyMP or Property...Property is a machine project for CCPROG1 class at De La Salle University. 

This is a console turn-based two-player board game. Players compete to acquire wealth by buying or renting properties. The game ends when a player goes bankrupt, i.e. he does not have enough money to pay rent.
